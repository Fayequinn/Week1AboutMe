    <h2  id="aboutme" >A little bit about me</h2> 
    <p> My name is Vicki, this is the first time I have ever used any kind of coding software so bare with me! This is a new challenge for me and if you'd have told me this morning that I would be creating a web page this afternoon I would have laughed, infact if you'd have asked me at lunch time I would have cried!  On a more serious note, I love learning, doing new things, spending time with my family and friends, going out for meals and travelling all over the place in our motorhome.  We all love paddleboarding....including the dog!</p>

        <p>Last Year I graduated from university with a degree in Psychology and ever since have been trying to find a new path that will challenge me and enable me to build a new career now my girls are older and I have more time to spare, I am excited to be on this course as I have already learn't so many new things that I didn't think I was capable of doing</p>
        <h2 id="myfamily" >My Family</h2>
        <p> I am a mum of 2 girls, Georgia aged 16 and Gracie-Lea aged 14.  Georgia also has a keen interest in software development and is hoping to go to university and do a computer science degree.  Gracie-Lea hasn't quite made her mind up yet, however, I have no doubt she will be amazing at whatever she chooses to do as from an early age she has wanted to be a successful bussiness woman and has been successfull in all sorts of projects already!  I am married to phil, we have been together for over 20 years and we have been married for the last 7.5 years. I am also a doggy mummy to Fletcher who is a 5 year old Rottweiler and also my favorite!

       <p>My favourite place out of all the places we have been has to be Lake Bala in Wales, its so beautiful and quiet there and the lake is amazing for the paddle boards.</p>

    <p>As I mentioned earlier, In our spare time as a family we enjoy going away in our motorhome and taking the paddleboards to new places, since we have had the van we have been to lots of different places, below is a table of my top 5!  Last summer a group of 6 families went to Talybont and the beach was amazing
